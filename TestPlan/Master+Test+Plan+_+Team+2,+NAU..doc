<h4 id=3D"MasterTestPlan|Team2,NAU.-OurScope:"><u>Our Scope:</u>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The objective of this test is to validate the Flight Management System o=
f Delta Air Lines that allows customers to <strong>Book a Flight</strong> w=
hich includes the features of <u>searching flights, trip type, passengers, =
seats, and purchase flight.</u> The project team and the test team will hav=
e a high level of confidence in completing the test process so that the sys=
tem will operate in accordance with user requirements and satisfy all busin=
ess requirements. This test plan will cover the overview of the main featur=
es, but each feature will have many other test cases we will perform from w=
ithin. For this test plan, we will the top overview features within <strong=
>Book Flight.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id=3D"MasterTestPlan|Team2,NAU.-TestObjectives:"><u>Test Objectives:</u=
>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Search Flight&nbsp;</p>
<p>When searching for a flight, users will need to enter <u>destination and=
 origin,&nbsp;dates of arrival and return,&nbsp;number of passengers, and r=
ound trip or one-way</u>. A list of flights will appear where they will hav=
e a choice to select which one best suits them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Trip Type&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you find the flight that best suits you, you will continue to selec=
t what <u>type of trip</u> you want, whether it's main, comfort, or first c=
lass. After you select your trip type, you might have to select trip type a=
gain for your returning flight if you have selected round trip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page Overview of your Selected Flight&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are done selecting your trip type, you will then be prompted wi=
th a page of your flights with the ability to <u>add seats,</u> <u>upgrade =
your trip type,</u> and the ability to <u>buy a refundable flight plan</u> =
or just purchase your flight right away&nbsp;</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Seats&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the seat feature, you will have the ability to <u>select each seat<=
/u> for each of the passengers flying and you can <u>add more passengers</u=
> here as well. You will also have the ability to adjust your trip type her=
e since your trip type depends on where you want to sit (for example. First=
 class flyers sit upfront). Then, select your seat by clicking one of the s=
eats on the user interface. You will then get prompted with the same option=
s for the second flight if you selected round trip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purchase Flight&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you select to purchase your flight from the <u>Page Overview of you=
r Selected Flight</u>, it adds a couple more features to the page. Now you =
also can <u>add a payment method</u> and <u>passenger information</u> and <=
u>contact info.</u> You will fill out the required information so you can c=
ontinue to complete the transaction of purchasing. You can also <u>add trip=
 protection</u> to protect your trip here. The ability to <u>add gift cards=
</u> and <u>collect SkyMiles</u> is all listed under this feature as well.&=
nbsp;</p>
<p>f) Select Passengers&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you purchase your flight completely, you need&nbsp;to add your <u=
>passenger information</u> on the <u>Purchase your Flight page.</u> &nbsp;<=

<h4 id=3D"MasterTestPlan|Team2,NAU.-Risk-Product">Risk- Product&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Test across the devices (Desktop, Smartphones, Tablets)&nbsp=
;</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Risks associated with testing different types of devices include users n=
ot being able to access the same type of features as other users. Another r=
isk includes not being able to access the biggest features of the Delta web=
site because their UI configuration is all messed up and inaccessible due t=
o different device-responsive reactions to the types of technologies being =
implemented.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Test across different browsers</strong>&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The risk associated with different browsers is that the website can be d=
isplayed differently so we need to make sure Delta is displayed the same ac=
ross all platforms because some&nbsp;browsers react differently to code.&nb=
sp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Testing Delta flight management system.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;=
</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Search for flights.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The risk associated with searching for a flight&nbsp;includes users sele=
cting the wrong types of airports when searching for a trip. For example, y=
ou would think MPL is a Minneapolis airport, but really, MPL is an airport =
in France. We must show users exactly the Airport abbreviation and the full=
 city/state/country name under that, so users don=E2=80=99t get confused an=
d book the wrong flight.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Search trip type.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The risk associated with trip type is that a user might think all trip t=
ypes cost the same amount, so we must test and make sure a price is listed =
under each trip type, so users know that each type costs a different price.=
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Select passengers.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The risk associated with selecting a passenger in=
cludes dealing with passengers and how they will receive their refunds or c=
ancellations. For example, someone booked a trip for 3 people and bought th=
e trips for all of them. Now, 1 of the passengers wants to cancel their fli=
ght. We need to make sure that the ticket only cancels for that 1 person, a=
nd not everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Select seats. </strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Risks associated with seat selection include users not being prompted th=
at seat selection is mandatory, so users breeze by seat selection and total=
ly forget about it. We need to show the users that they can choose their se=
ats even though it's not required.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Select baggage </strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The risk associated with selecting baggage is selecting the incorrect nu=
mber of bags you currently need.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Purchasing flight / Select payment methods </strong></p></li=
>
</ul>
<p>The risk associated with payment methods is that our system must verify =
each individual credit card before accepting its payment&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Usability testing</strong>&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Usability testing is a way we can make risk float to the top easier beca=
use we need the website to be efficient and effective as possible and usabi=
lity testing will help us see what=E2=80=99s not working.&nbsp;</p>
